     * variables for playing a track
     * 
     * Q: In general, when/how should we init the playback vars? Esp curEvent
     * and curSectionIndex?
     * ATM it's a little schizophrenic. we mostly change them when we finish playing
     * a section. But we also init from from reset and setSong().
     * 
     * Maybe we need a flag to tell us when to do setup? we sort of use reset() for that now,
     * but it's not a flag. We could do something like
     * bool needsReset (or even put it in event Q!!!), as well as
     * bool needsPlaySetup
     *      if true, then play calls will check it first. If set, clear and do one-time setup
     *      set it from reset.
     * 
     * Do we want to get away from requiring a reset call to set up playback? Could 
     * we use isPlaying instead? Sure, we can do that.
     * But - is there any difference between a reset and a change in playing status? I guess it's
     * fine to have two API's (setRunningStatus and reset()) to set it, but it's only one thing,
     * and it should probably live.... in the event Q.
     * 
     * can we use event Q for all requests to go to different sections, even the normal playback transitions?
     * I think so, if we are careful to set the requests before we process them. Oh, but when we are playing back we 
     * can easily blow through multiple events, so the section changes need to be more lock-step.
     * Now I'm thinking we can't we need functions to advance it. But they should be very clearly playback functions.
     * 
     * In the future, we may not want reset to change sections. but "hard reset" should.
     * 
     * How many resets are there:
     *      setup to play from current location (edit conflict reset)
     *      setup to play from the very start (hard reset / reset CV)
     *      setup to lay from very start (first playback after new song)???
     * 
     * If we never hard reset (from cv) when will we ever setup to play?
     * 
     * Recent ideas: functions to be called during playback, preceded with 'pb'. can assert in PB
     * (still maybe should put pb variable in a struct?)
     * 
     * 
     * Plan:
     *      X move setSongRequests into the queue
     *      remove getSong API
     *      move reset requests into the queue
     *      get rid of un-necessary reset calls in unit tests()
     * 
     * 
     * FIRST serious issue. Failing testTwoSectionsStartOnSecond. We should start right up on the queud section,
     * but we don't. because we only service that from end of clip. 
     * Idea: store a flag when we request a section: eventQ.sectionRequestWhenStopped.
     * If that flag is set, we will act on it when we service queue.
     * 
     * ACTUALLY, the above is a problem, but the immediate problem is that curTrack isn't getting
     * set up, so even after we "play" it's null, which makes get Section return 0;
